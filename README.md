# battleships in c++
This is my take on battleships done entirely in c++. 

### Overview:
This game is a user vs computer battleships game, with features like options for manual or automatic ship placement, game difficulty, and a timer for each game.

### Manual:
The game starts with the user entering their name, then they choose the game difficulty. Hardmode will make the computer smarter in guessing the user's ship location.

The user is then given the option of either manually placing their ships, or having their ships manually placed. 

If they choose to manually place their ships, they can click and drag a ship to place it. To rotate a ship, press 'R' while dragging it.

After the user is done placing their ships, they click next and the game starts.

The users hits a block on the computer's board by clicking it, and the aim of the game is to be the first to destroy the other player's ships.

After the game is over, the game duration is displayed, and the user can either end the program, or start a new game.
